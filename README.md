## What to keep balanced?

Does it make sense to balance stocks based on the market cap of the company?  For now just assume we're trying to keep the value of each holding the same over time.

Take the total value of the portfolio.  Then divide by the number of holdings (stocks or later sectors).  This is the target value for a holding.
If it's lower than the target, then buy, if it's higher than the target, sell.


## Todo

0. Try to balance them
1. Simulate returns based on historical data
2. Pull real data for specific stocks (Yahoo Finance?)
3. Take into account tax basis
3. Import portfolio from CSV file
