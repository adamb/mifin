# Mi Finance

Start playing around with computational finance.  

## SP50

Try to emulate and S&P 50 ETF.  

## What to keep balanced?

Does it make sense to balance stocks based on the market cap of the company?  For now just assume we're trying to keep the value of each holding the same over time.

## Todo

1. Simulate returns based on historical data
2. Pull real data for specific stocks (Yahoo Finance?)
3. Take into account tax basis
3. Import portfolio from CSV file
